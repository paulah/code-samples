I pledge on my honor that I have neither given nor
received any unauthorized assistance on this assignment.

1. 
0 threads: 3.950288s wall; 3.914405s user; 0.019997s sys
1 thread : 3.055881s wall; 2.988546s user; 0.051992s sys
2 threads: 1.936914s wall; 3.708436s user; 0.053992s sys
4 threads: 0.937539s wall; 2.907558s user; 0.054992s sys

2. Wall time speedup (nonthreaded/threaded)
1 thread : 1.292684
2 threads: 2.039475
4 threads: 4.213465

3. User time speedup (nonthreaded/threaded)
1 thread : 1.309802
2 threads: 1.055541
4 threads: 1.346286

4. As the number of threads working on mergesort increases,
the amount of time to perform decreases. Note that this only applies to wall
time; there is not a significant amount of speedup in user time.
As the number of theads doubles, speedup also doubles for wall time.
Thus speedup should increase at a constant rate as the number of threads
becomes larger because speedup is proportional to the number of threads.
